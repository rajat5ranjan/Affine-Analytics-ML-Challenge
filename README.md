## Recommender Systems Collaborative/Hybrid Filtering

## Problem Statement
To develop a targeting strategy to market the right properties to the right customers (accounts)

## Problem Description
The problem is to market the right set of properties to the accounts to maximize the property sale. It is essential that we arrive at an optimum number of suggested properties (‘n’) that we are targeting to the customers. If the numbers of properties that are being suggested are high then the customer acquisition cost goes up. On the other hand, if the number of suggested properties is low then it is likely that we might fail to market suitable properties to the customer which might end up in lesser properties being converted.

## Goal
Recommend the list of ‘n’ properties that should be marketed to the accounts in the Test Dataset. The final evaluation will include both the factors - ‘ the optimal number of properties suggested’ and **the number of properties converted**.
